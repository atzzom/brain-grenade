<!-- 
<ol class="code-sample">
  <li>Add the following behaviour: First show only the background image/photo, once and only once the user has scrolled to show the entire photo, only then show the motto. After that show the effect saw in many websites: whilst the user is still scrolling the background image is barely scrolled while the motto scrolls to the normal speed.</li>
	<li>Think about an interesting way to introduce the next frame, in a way that do not disclose the whole content to the user, maybe a blurred effect on the photo/image and later disclose the sharp/clear image. The effect described in the previous item is then repeated.</li>
	<li>Make sure the page has design, usability, and user experience in mind.</li>
	<li>Practice makes perfect, and work on quality not quantity, a whole bunch of images with slogans won't cut it, instead even a single image where all concept have been thought of will help to learn better than the first approach</li>
</ol>
